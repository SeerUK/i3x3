package main

// i3x3-fix is used to redistribute i3's workspaces in a way that will allow i3x3 to function
// correctly. It's a particularly useful utility if you work on a laptop and add / remove displays,
// as i3 will automatically move workspaces around for you.
//
// i3x3 automatically adjusts it's grid size, expanding to fit in new workspaces, but because of the
// way it expects workspaces to be arranged, it can get into a bad state when displays are added or
// removed.
//
// When using this tool, your desktop may look a little bit crazy whilst it's re-arranging your
// workspaces - but it should be quite quick!
